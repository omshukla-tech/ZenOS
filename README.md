# ZenOs

Your distro kit from linuxlive.com: the spec that describes ZenOs
and its art.

    linuxlive.yaml          the spec
    assets/                 wallpaper and logo

## Build it in your own GitHub (no Linux needed)

1. Open https://github.com/Eric-Ness/linuxlive-distro, click "Use this
   template", then "Create a new repository". Keep it public: builds are
   free and the ISO can be downloaded.
2. In your new repository choose "Add file", then "Upload files", and drop
   in everything from this kit except this README (linuxlive.yaml and its
   folders). They replace the template's example. Commit.
3. Open the Actions tab. The build takes about 20 minutes for Ubuntu and 40
   for Fedora; it boots the ISO five ways and checks it against your spec.
4. Open the finished run and download "iso-zenos" under Artifacts: a zip
   with zenos.iso and its checksum.

## Or build it on your own Linux machine

Building locally needs root, podman, QEMU and a few ISO tools; see
https://docs.linuxlive.com/spec/building-locally/ for the full list.

    git clone https://github.com/Eric-Ness/linuxlive
    cd linuxlive
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m linuxlive validate ../zenos/linuxlive.yaml
    python -m linuxlive compile ../zenos/linuxlive.yaml -o build/ctx
    sudo podman build -t localhost/zenos build/ctx
    sudo bash scripts/assemble-iso.sh build/ctx localhost/zenos build/zenos.iso

## Then boot it

Put the ISO on a USB stick and start a PC from it: https://linuxlive.com/learn/

## Show where it came from
